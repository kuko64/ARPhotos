# ARPhotos

Augmented Reality App overlays digital videos onto real world photos and lets the user interact with them.
This demo has 3 different image targets implemented but can be extended. 
On start the camera will open and scan the area. Once the app recognizes one of the photos, the video will appear replacing the photo. The user will then have some possibilities to interact with the app. Below the photo/video, there is a button to play or pause the video, or even replay it.
